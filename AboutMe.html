Hi, my name is Prisha Kedia. I'm 14 and I'm originally from India. You'll find me very inquisitive. I'm usually a very happy, optimistic and ambitious person. I love art to another extent and dancing is my passion. Currently as a campus ambassador at Roobaroo, I've discovered a whole new world of creativity. Speaking of my dreams, I want to travel every corner of the world, make the best out of myself and live as happily as possible. <br>
